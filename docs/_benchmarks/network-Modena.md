## Description

The Modena system is based on the water distribution system in Modena, Italy and was originally developed by Bragalli et
al. in 2008 as part of a design optimization study. The system has a total demand of 53,000 CMD, four reservoirs, and 72
km of pipe. It is classified as distribution dense-grid by Hwang & Lansey (2017) and looped by Hoagland et al. (2015).

It was published 2021 by University of Kentucky Libraries.

The network consists of 268 nodes (junctions), 317 pipes and 4 reservoirs.

## How to Use

The Modena network is provided as an .inp file and can be loaded into EPANET or any other software package
supporting .inp files.

### Usage in Python

The Modena network is also available in Python through the key "*Network-Modena*":
```python
network = load("Network-Modena")
modena_inp = network.load()
```

Detailed information about the provided functionality can be found in the documentation of
[`load()`](https://water-benchmark-hub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/water_benchmark_hub.networks.html#water_benchmark_hub.networks.networks.Modena.load).
