## Description

This challenge is about controlling the chlorination for mitigating and reacting to wastewater contamination events and other time-varying dynamics in a simulated water distribution system (a modified version of the [CY-DBP](network-CY-DBP.html)). Note that Chlorine is added to water distribution systems primarily as a disinfectant to kill harmful bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, ensuring safe drinking water.

*The task in this challenge is to control the injection of chlorine (Cl) at 5 locations, based on the readings of a few strategically placed hydraulic and chlorine sensors only.*

Instead of data sets, this competition provides environments (i.e., simulation scenarios) for developing and evaluating control algorithms. The challenge provides ten 6-day long scenarios for facilitating the training of AI-based methods -- note that all scenarios are for the same water network (same sensors and chlorine injection pumps) but with different (randomized) contamination events. Furthermore, there is also an 11th scenario available, which is 365 days long -- same network, same sensors, and chlorine injection pumps as the 6-day long scenarios.
