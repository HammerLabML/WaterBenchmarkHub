## Description

The Battle of Background Leakage Assessment for Water Networks is the fifth in the series of
"Battle Competitions" dating back to the Battle of the Water Networks (BWN) in 1985.

The BBLAWN was part of the 16th Water Distribution Systems Analysis Conference (WDSA 2014),
held in Bari (Italy) in 2014.
It utilizes the [C-Town network](network-CTown.html) and is about designing methodology for
reducing water losses due to background leakages and apply it to a real water distribution system.
