## Description

The Battle of Water Networks District Metered Areas is the sixth in the series of
"Battle Competitions" dating back to the Battle of the Water Networks (BWN) in 1985.
It was part of the 18th Water Distribution Systems Analysis Conference (WDSA 2016) in Cartagena,
Colombia in July 2016.

The competition was focused on the challenge of network sectorization, that is, determination of
the new district metered areas (DMAs) for an existing network. Design requirements involved
constraints related to costs, pressure uniformity, and water quality. Changes in valve and pump
operations were needed to supply demands at adequate pressures and acceptable water quality for
the given supply scenarios: a wet season and a dry season with water shortages.
