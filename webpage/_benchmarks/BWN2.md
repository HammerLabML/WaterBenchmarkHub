## Description

The Battle of the Water Networks (BWN-II) is the fourth in a series of "Battle Competitions"
dating back to the Battle of the Water Networks (BWN) in 1985.

The BWN-II competition was part of the 14th Water Distribution Systems Analysis conference in
Adelaide, Australia, September 2012.
The problem specification involved a broadly defined design and operation problem for an existing
network that has to be upgraded for increased future demands, and the addition of a new development
area. The design decisions involved addition of new and parallel pipes, storage,
operational controls for pumps and valves, and sizing of backup power supply.
Design criteria involved hydraulic, water quality, reliability, and environmental
performance measures.
